# TUTORIAL CISCO PACKET TRACER
# Hi, I'm Kartik Chandra Ghosh! ðŸ‘‹

### What is cisco packet tracer 
Cisco Packet Tracer as the name suggests, is a tool built by Cisco. This tool provides a network simulation to practice simple and complex networks. 

The main purpose of Cisco Packet Tracer is to help students learn the principles of networking with hands-on experience as well as develop Cisco technology specific skills. Since the protocols are implemented in software only method, this tool cannot replace the hardware Routers or Switches. Interestingly, this tool does not only include Cisco products but also many more networking devices.

Using this tool is widely encouraged as it is part of the curriculum like CCNA, CCENT where Faculties use Packet Trace to demonstrate technical concepts and networking systems. Students complete assignments using this tool, working on their own or in teams.
